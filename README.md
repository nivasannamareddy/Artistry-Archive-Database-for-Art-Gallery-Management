# Artistry-Archive-Database-for-Art-Gallery-Management
The Artistry Archive project is designed to serve as a robust and scalable database
management system for modern art galleries, museums, and art-related institutions. It
enables the efficient management of art collections, artist portfolios, exhibition
schedules, and sales transactions. By centralizing these critical data points, the system
facilitates easy access to vital information, enhances operational efficiency, and
supports informed decision-making.
This outlines the design, scope, and architecture of the database layer of the Artistry
Archive, focusing on its ability to store, retrieve, and manage vast amounts of structured
art-related data.
